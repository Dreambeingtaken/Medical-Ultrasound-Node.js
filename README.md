Ultrasound to patient and patient to Ultrasound relaying via my style in Javascript (Node.js) IMAGING

Trained deep net module for an ultrasound imaging. It is made on C programming and CodeWarrior IDE. What if we process faster imaging by javascript relays? This is my code on how it could work, it's my research, kindly comment on it and tell your thoughts. I believe there are better machines than Ultrasound, but this code might help, I MEAN MIGHT HELP, for low profit organisations with just java.

# How do I pull this? ðŸ”¥
Creating a Node.js application for managing ultrasound data in a medical setting involves several components, including handling patient data, storing ultrasound images. 

# How to verify this?
Providing a web interface to medical professionals. (I'm trying hard for it man send help)
Well well well, I am an expert at MongoDB so it won't be an issue.
Below is a simple example of how you might set this up using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. 

/ultrasound-app
|-- /models
|   |-- Patient.js
|   |-- Ultrasound.js
|-- /routes
|   |-- patients.js
|   |-- ultrasounds.js
|-- /uploads
|-- app.js
|-- package.json


`Models and routes` are required.
