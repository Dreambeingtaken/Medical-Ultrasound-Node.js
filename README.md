# Medical-Ultrasound-Node.js ðŸ”¥
Ultrasound to patient and patient to Ultrasound relaying via my style in Javascript (Node.js) IMAGING

# WARNING: This code has Apache 2.0 license and copyright on my name ðŸ”´

Trained deep net module for an ultrasound imaging. It is made on C programming and CodeWarrior IDE. What if we process faster imaging by javascript relays? This is my code on how it could work, it's my research, kindly comment on it and tell your thoughts. I believe there are better machines than Ultrasound, but this code might help, I MEAN MIGHT HELP, for low profit organisations with just java.

# How do I pull this? ðŸ”¥
Creating a Node.js application for managing ultrasound data in a medical setting involves several components, including handling patient data, storing ultrasound images. 

# How to verify this?
Providing a web interface to medical professionals. (I'm trying hard for it man send help)
Well well well, I am an expert at MongoDB so it won't be an issue.
Below is a simple example of how you might set this up using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. 

/ultrasound-app
|-- /models
|   |-- Patient.js
|   |-- Ultrasound.js
|-- /routes
|   |-- patients.js
|   |-- ultrasounds.js
|-- /uploads
|-- app.js
|-- package.json


`Models and routes` are required.

### Content (In python type, API data)
* [DummyLoader](DummyLoader/) - Example loader library
* [Image3dAPI](Image3dAPI/)   - API definitions
* [PackagingGE](PackagingGE/) - NuGet packaging configuration
* [RegFreeTest](RegFreeTest/) - Example of how to leverage manifest files to avoid COM registration
* [SandboxTest](SandboxTest/) - Example of how to sandbox a loader in a separate process
* [TestPython](TestPython/)   - Python-based sample code
* [TestViewer](TestViewer/)   - Simple .NET-based image viewer

# Step 1: Initialize the Project
# Step 2: Step 2: Create the Models
models/Patient.js
models/Ultrasound.js
# Step 3: Create the Routes
routes/patients.js
routes/Ultrasound.js
# Step 4: Set Up the Main Application
app.js
# Step 5: Run the Application
- Make sure MongoDB is running on your machine.
- You can use tools like Postman to test the API endpoints.

## Additional Considerations
Authentication and Authorization: Ensure proper security measures are in place to protect patient data.
Image Handling: You may want to implement more robust image storage and handling (e.g., using AWS S3).
Validation: Add validation for input data to ensure it meets the expected formats.
Error Handling: Implement comprehensive error handling to manage potential issues.
